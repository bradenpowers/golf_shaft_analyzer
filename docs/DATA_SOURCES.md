### Secondary Sources (Validation)

- Manufacturer PDF catalogs and spec sheets
- GolfWRX shaft database and forum discussions
- Club fitting cart specifications
- Authorized retailer product listings

## Data Quality

Every shaft entry should be traceable to a manufacturer source. When manufacturer data conflicts with secondary sources, the manufacturer spec sheet takes precedence.

### Known Limitations

- Some manufacturers don't publish all specifications (e.g., butt diameter, exact tip stiffness ratings)
- Torque and launch/spin profiles can vary slightly between published specs and independent testing
- MSRP may vary by region; all prices listed in USD
- Discontinued models may have specs that are no longer available on manufacturer websites

## Contributing Data

If you have access to spec sheets not yet in the database, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit them.
